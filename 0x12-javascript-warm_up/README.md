# Project on 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up 

## Background Context

## JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

   	-  Scripting (same as we did with Python)
	-  Web front-end

## For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General

    Why JavaScript programming is amazing
    How to run a JavaScript script
    How to create variables and constants
    What are differences between var, const and let
    What are all the data types available in JavaScript
    How to use the if, if ... else statements
    How to use comments
    How to affect values to variables
    How to use while and for loops
    How to use break and continue statements
    What is a function and how do you use functions
    What does a function that does not use any return statement return
    Scope of variables
    What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
    How to manipulate dictionary
    How to import a file

## Requirements

## General

   	 Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
   	 All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
    	All your files should end with a new line
    	The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/node
    	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    	Your code should be semistandard compliant (version 16.x.x). Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
    	All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Mandatory Tasks Starts Here

0. First constant, first print 
	- Write a script that prints “JavaScript is amazing”:

    		You must create a constant variable called myVar with the value “JavaScript is amazing”
    		You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    		You are not allowed to use var

1. 3 languages
	Write a script that prints 3 lines:

    The first line: “C is fun”
    The second line: “Python is cool”
    The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var


2. Arguments 
	Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:

    If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
    If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
    Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var


4. Create a sentence 
	Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var

3. Value of my argument
	Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

    If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You are not allowed to use length

4. Create a sentence 
	Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var


5. An Integer
	Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer:

    If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You are not allowed to use try/catch

6. Loop to languages 
	Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

    The first line: “C is fun”
    The second line: “Python is cool”
    The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You are not allowed to use any if/else statement
    You can use only one console.log
    You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

7. I love C 
	Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”

    Where x is the first argument of the script
    If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing number of occurrences”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You can use only two console.log
    You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

Write a script that prints a square
	
    The first argument is the size of the square
    If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
    You must use the character X to print the square
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)

8. Square 
	Write a script that prints a square

    The first argument is the size of the square
    If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
    You must use the character X to print the square
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
    You must use a loop (while, for, etc.)
